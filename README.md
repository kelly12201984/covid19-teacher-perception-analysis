COVID-19 Behavioral Research: Educator Decision-Making & Perceptions
📘 Overview
This research project analyzes K–12 educators' decision-making processes and instructional perceptions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Designed as the capstone for the M.Ed. in Evaluation, Assessment, Research, and Learning at Georgia Southern University, the study used a mixed-methods approach combining survey data, regression analysis, and ANOVA to uncover how teachers responded to distance learning requirements and shifting instructional priorities.

🎯 Objectives
Understand how educators perceived distance learning effectiveness during COVID-19.

Explore factors influencing instructional decisions and teacher confidence.

Identify patterns in teacher behavior and response to remote learning environments.

Apply behavioral modeling concepts and quantitative methods to education research.

🧪 Methods
Data Collection: Survey distributed to K–12 educators during peak pandemic response (2020–2021).

Quantitative Analysis:

Conducted ANOVA and linear regression to explore relationships between teaching experience, comfort with online tools, and instructional choices.

Qualitative Insights:

Thematic coding of open-ended responses to contextualize quantitative results.

Frameworks Used:

CIPP Model (Context, Input, Process, Product)

IRB-compliant survey design

Principles from behavioral economics and mathematical psychology

📊 Key Findings
Educator confidence and decision-making were highly influenced by prior exposure to digital tools.

Teachers perceived a significant decline in student engagement, even when adapting content.

There was a measurable shift toward autonomy in content delivery during school closures.

Behavioral and perceptual data revealed underlying stress factors that impacted instruction quality.
