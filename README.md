## 📘 Overview

This project examines how K–12 teachers adapted to emergency remote instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using semi-structured interviews and thematic coding, the study surfaces educators’ lived experiences with digital platforms, workload changes, family engagement, and administrative support.

The research was conducted as part of my capstone project at Georgia Southern University and contributes to a broader understanding of decision-making, self-efficacy, and instructional design in crisis contexts.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand how educators perceived the effectiveness of distance learning during COVID-19.
- Explore behavioral and instructional decision-making under stress.
- Identify structural and psychological barriers to effective remote instruction.
- Apply qualitative research methods to inform future crisis-readiness strategies in education.

## 🧪 Methods

- **Participants:** 3 elementary school teachers (K–5) during Fall 2020  
- **Data Collection:** Semi-structured interviews (Zoom), anonymized, transcribed  
- **Qualitative Analysis:** Thematic coding across 5 core categories  
  - Lack of preparedness
  - Increased workload
  - Administrative breakdowns
  - Student/family engagement
  - Decline in teacher self-efficacy
- **Frameworks Used:**  
  - IRB-compliant procedures  
  - Interview Guide (adapted from Kennedy, 2001)  
  - CIPP Model (Context, Input, Process, Product)

## 📊 Key Findings

- Teachers experienced high levels of stress, burnout, and reduced instructional confidence.
- Minimal administrative guidance and unrealistic expectations added to cognitive overload.
- Educator workload increased by 30–50%, often requiring evening and weekend hours.
- Parent involvement was a critical—but inconsistent—factor in student success.
- Emergency response protocols lacked instructional continuity plans for prolonged closures.
